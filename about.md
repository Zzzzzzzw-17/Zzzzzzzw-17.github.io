## Hi, I'm Wei! 👋

I'm currently in my third year as a Ph.D. student at the **Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence** and **University of Augsburg**. My research centers on **tabular data understanding and reasoning**—helping machines make sense of the structured information that fills our world, from spreadsheets to databases.

Beyond tables, I'm fascinated by the broader challenges of **large language model reasoning** and **multimodal learning**. There's something compelling about teaching machines to think across different types of data—text, images, and structures—much like humans naturally do.

## Beyond Research

When I step away from research, I find balance in quieter pursuits:

<div class="hobby-title">🐱 Quality time with my cat</div>
<div class="hobby-desc">
There's something grounding about the simple companionship of a cat who couldn't care less about conference deadlines. My cat is the best reminder to pause, breathe, and appreciate the moment.

<div class="hobby-item">
<div class="hobby-title">🏚️ Urban exploration</div>
<div class="hobby-desc">
I'm drawn to abandoned places—forgotten factories, empty buildings, spaces where time has left its mark. There's a haunting beauty in these overlooked corners of the world, each telling stories through decay and silence.

<div class="hobby-title">📸 Photography of forgotten spaces</div>
<div class="hobby-desc">
I document these places before they vanish entirely. Every crumbling wall, broken window, and overgrown corridor holds a narrative waiting to be preserved. My camera becomes a bridge between past and present. You can find some of my collections 
in the Instagram.
